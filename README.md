# About Safty App
Safty App is a playful Android application for discovering, mixing, and enjoying smoothies, cocktails, and more. At its core is Safty, an interactive carafe that reacts to ingredient combinations and suggests personalized recipes.

Users earn XP by completing recipes and uploading drink photos, unlocking new ingredients and creative possibilities over time. A progression system guides beginners and rewards advanced users with the ability to create custom recipes. Alongside the interactive mode, Safty App also offers manual recipe search based on selected ingredients.
